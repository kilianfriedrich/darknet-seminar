The increasing threat of cyber attacks and the associated trade in leaked data on the dark web represents a serious challenge for society.
In recent years, there has been an increase in attacks in the form of ransomware attacks on healthcare facilities and thus also patient data available on the dark web.
In order to investigate the attackers' approach and techniques, it is necessary to identify and analyze the leaked data.
The aim of this project is to present a tool that searches the dark web for various parameters and provides data for further analysis.
There are several tools available on GitHub that could be used for this purpose (see sources).
Your task is to identify suitable tools and to explain and compare their functionality.
